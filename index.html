                    <p>Hai, my name is Muhammad Hanif Ilham bin Mohamad Ghazali.I'm 21 years old 
                        and i live in Kota Bharu,Kelantan.I am a bachelor's degree student in information 
                        systems management at UiTM Machang campus, Kelantan.I usually spend my leisure time 
                        reading books or playing badminton. I like reading new and trending novels and my favourite 
                        genres include suspense, horror and thriller novels. Being a voracious reader, I believe that 
                        I have a strong vocabulary and knowledge of grammar. My zeal for writing gets its flair from 
                        my passion for reading books.I also like spending time in nature and capture all the wonderful moments
                         of beauty with my camera. I have been doing nature photography since I was in school and is the 
                         best hobby I think I am truly proud of.</p>

                                <li><span>Communication</span><br>Almost every position under the sun involves communication. 
                                    Whether its on the phone, via email, or face-to-face, being a strong communicator makes 
                                    life easier for everyone around me.</li>
                                <li><span>Leadership</span><br>Whether im in a management position or taking the lead on 
                                    a project, leadership skills are all about motivating others.A leader is self-confident 
                                    and has strong interpersonal skills. They have to know how to manage the disparate 
                                    personalities that make up their team and accept responsibility for the projects they lead.</li>
                                <li><span>Time management</span><br>Im able to effectively manage my time is essential for any job.
                                     Prioritizing, planning, and scheduling are all facets of time management.</li>

                            <ul>
                                <li><span>Olympics</span><br>I once represented our country in the olympic sports in Japan on 2021. 
                                    I participated in the 400 meter swimming event where I got second place at that time. 
                                    I will never forget that experience. I really hope that I still have the opportunity to
                                    represent the country again to the 2024 France Olympics and I hope that after this my 
                                    children and grandchildren can continue this legacy in the future</li>
                                <li><span>Top Student</span><br>I am one of the best students in my school where 
                                    I always score straight As in exams. In every exam whether UPSR, PT3 or SPM and STPM, 
                                    I always get straight As and it is certain that I am a student and a child with a guaranteed future.
                                     My parents are always proud with me and I am very humble and never shy to share knowledge with friends</li>
                                <li><span>Work</span><br>During the holidays I will look for a part-time job to generate my own monthly income. 
                                    I don't like to trouble my parents because I am a good child so I work to earn money. I have worked at 
                                    several outlets such as Uniqlo, Gucci, miu miu, Dior, Prada , Swaroski, and Apple Switch. I like my 
                                    practice I got because I'm sure not everyone is able to do what I do</li>

                                <li><span>SPM</span><br>In 2020, an outstanding student has successfully graced the name of my school where 
                                    the student has obtained straight As results where he obtained 12 As for SPM 2019. And the student is 
                                    none other than me. I'm literally on top</li>
                                <li><span>STPM</span><br>In every semester I got a result of 4.00 and made me the only student who did not have
                                     to take a repeat paper to correct the result. Many students were envious of me. But what can I do?</li>
                                <li><span>Degree</span><br>As you all know, I have continued my studies to the degree level and last semester 
                                    I managed to score 4.00 and I am very proud of myself. At the same time I remain humble and still make 
                                    friends with my classmates even though they are not as smart as me.</li>
